## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective**: Understand public sentiment during the U.S. elections by analyzing Twitter chatter.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Collect relevant tweets mentioning election candidates.
  - Clean and preprocess tweets (remove noise, tokenize, stem/lemmatize).
  - Perform sentiment analysis to classify opinions as positive, negative, or neutral.
  - Visualize sentiment trends over time and across candidates.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Collection**: Uses Twitter API (or `tweepy`) to fetch tweets in real time or batch mode.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Clean tweets by removing URLs, mentions, emojis, non-alphanumeric chars.
  - Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization using NLTK/spaCy.
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Sentiment scoring using VADER (from `nltk.sentiment`).
  - Alternative machine-learning approach using Scikit-learn classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) on TF-IDF features.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Time series plots of sentiment trends per candidate.
  - Bar charts showing distribution of sentiment classes.
  - Word clouds highlighting key positive/negative terms.
